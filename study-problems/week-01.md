## Problems
1. Concept check: What does “superposition” mean in electrostatics?
2. Two point charges \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are separated by distance \(r\). Write the force on \(q_1\) due to \(q_2\), with direction.
3. (Numerical) Compute the magnitude of the force between \(+2\,\mu C\) and \(-3\,\mu C\) separated by \(0.50\,m\).

## Optional: solutions policy
- (Add your policy: in-class, after deadline, partial solutions, etc.)
